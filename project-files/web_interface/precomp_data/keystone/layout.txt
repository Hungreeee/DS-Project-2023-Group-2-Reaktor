Title : Keystone Species

Keystone species play a considerable role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. 
In Finland, there are several of them, but we focus on the yellow-breasted buntings in this webpage.
The effect of yellow-breasted bunting on the biodiversity of trees and birds.

Yellow-breasted buntings breed in Europe and migrate to Asia during winter. 
There, they are illegally hunted for a special dish and their number has decreased dramatically since 2004. 
Before that, they were listed as the 'Least Concerned', but, in just 10 years, their status became 'Critically Endangered'. 
In Finland, this birds has officially gone extinct, not only due to the extensive hunting but also because of the climate and habitat changes. 
Below, we study how biodiversity of trees and birds changes according to the recorded observations of yellow-breasted bunting, 
therefore giving an example of how keystone species might affect the ecosystem.

We study areas that used to have recorded observations of yellow-breasted bunting. 
In particular, we collect data of trees and birds in area with yellow-breasted bunting before, during, and after the time spans in which there were observations of yellow-breasted bunting.
In the time periods before and after such time spans, data are collected in 3-years intervals. The average species richness of such areas during these time periods is calculated:

![tree](tree_average_timeseries_bunting)
![bird](bird_average_timeseries_bunting)

It is visible that there was an increase in average biodiversity richness from the period before to after recorded observations of yellow-breasted bunting, 
peaking at the time span of 1 to 3 years after last recorded observations. 
In fact, the most statistically significant difference for both trees and birds data is between the period 1 to 3 years before and 1 to 3 years after recorded observations of yellow-breasted bunting,
with higher than 95% confidence interval. The specific effect for each area is visualized as:

![bird](bird_paired_bunting_effect)

On the other hand, the effect of the species' decline remains unclear for the inspected time period.
However, such decline can be speculated to negatively affect species richness, as species richness reached a peak in time span of 1 to 3 years after last recorded observations despite the previous increasing trend.
Noticeably, the species richness of trees even showed a downturn trend after reaching such peak.
