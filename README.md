<h1 align="center">Interactive Biodiversity Infographics</h1>


This project was assigned by representatives of Reaktor as an exercise inworking as a team of data consultants for a client. In the exercise, the
client was the author of a biology textbook, looking to acquire
interactive web info pages about biodiversity to support their
materials. We were instructed to take lead on the implementation of the
website, while assuring the product follows the client's goals. A
dataset of species observations form laji.fi was to be used to model and
visualize biodiversity, as well as build and publish an implementation
of the web page. Associations to possible underlying factors affecting
biodiversity were also to be explored.
